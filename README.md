# Foodborne Pathogen Detection 
## PHP 2550 Practical Data Analysis: Final Project

This project aims to track and predict the source of foodborne pathogen: Listeria, using the NCBI Pathogen Detection System.

Data source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens 

We propose to use machine learning methods to tackle this problem. This preliminary repository contains the code for exploratory data analsis on the Listeria monocytogenes data set downloaded on Oct 23, 2022. Raw data and intermediate data sets are also documented. 

Future work will be updated to this repository, including graphs, code for further feature engineering and modeling techniques.
